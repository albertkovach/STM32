# Features
- STM32 internal RTC with backup battery was used
- a few color clock faces taken from the internet
- one clock face in 240x240 pixel resolution compressed to 4-bits takes only 29K of memory so even 2 could fit in STM32 memory
- watch hands are are vector based
- no floating-point arithmetic and slow trigonometric functions were used
